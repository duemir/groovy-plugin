<div>
    Selects a version of Groovy to add to the system path.
    If you leave this at <b>(Default)</b> then <code>groovy</code> will just run the CLI
    (<code>groovy.ui.GroovyMain</code>) from the version of Groovy currently bundled in Jenkins.
    This is enough for simple scripts, but does not support specific command-line options of the full Groovy launcher.
